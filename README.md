## Running the tests

This repository allows the user to:
1. download the necessary datasets;
2. bring up a Docker container with Oracle 11g;
3. load the datasets into Oracle;
4. run the tests.

Running the experiments requires the following software to be installed:
- Docker
- Java 14
- Python 3.10.4

Once the software is installed, execute the following code to run the tests.

    chmod +x *.sh
    ./start.sh
    ./stop.sh

## Working and deploying the application

- Change the necessary files (see the ones copied by `init.sh`)
- Deploy the web application on Tomcat

        ./deploy.sh

- **Remember** to `chmod -R 777` the folders `scr/main/python` and the one containing the Oracle client 
- (If using Intellij) **Remember** to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in the run/debug configuration (see the `.env` file)
